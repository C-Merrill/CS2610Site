    <h1>Entry 2</h1>

    <p>I've been using Emacs for a while, but never took the time to master the keyboard shortcuts. Today, I learned how to open files using C-x C-f and how to switch between open buffers, so I can edit multiple files at once. Because there is no visual interface evidence of other open buffers, I assumed that you can only have one file open at a time. Now I can work much more productively in this editor.</p>
